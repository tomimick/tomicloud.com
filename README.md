Static files for my blog site [tomicloud.com](http://tomicloud.com).

My blog site was originally developed with Django framework in 2012 and the
web app used to run on the great [Linode](http://www.linode.com) VPS hosting
platform.  Early 2015 I exported the blog as static files to Github
Pages.

When I need to update the blog (I wish I had the time), I run Django locally
and export the web pages via simple Python crawler that I cooked up, and
finally commit the files to Github. Voila.

The blog static files are in the
[gh-pages](https://github.com/tomimick/tomicloud.com/tree/gh-pages) branch if
you wonder.
