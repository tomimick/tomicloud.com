## Privacy Policy - GooMemo

GooMemo is a notes application from the early days of Android. It participated
in AndroidDeveloperContest2 in 2009.

This privacy policy is required because of these 2 app permissions:

**android.permission.CAMERA** - This permission is ofcourse required to attach
an image from the camera to a note.

**android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE** - This permission is not actually
needed, or it was required for an older Android version years ago. This
permission has caused general confusion among the developers.

Please be assured that you are safe in using this app.
