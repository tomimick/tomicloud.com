<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>When you use the Plango services, we may collect personal or other information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

<p>We collect your personal data when you voluntarily choose to provide such data. Voluntarily provided data includes data related to plans that you create, data that you type when commenting plans, feedback that you give through the feedback form and data that you provide as a part of the registration. By voluntarily providing us personal data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By voluntarily providing us personal data you also agree that such data can be transferred from your current location to our offices and servers, or to offices and servers of our contractors and partners located in Finland, UK, US or other countries.</p>

<p>During registration you provide us information about yourself such as name, email address, phone number, and picture. Some of this information is available to users, who are members in the same Plans as you are or to whom a plan, where you are a member, is shared to. We may use your contact information to send you information regarding our services. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address, and contact information to respond to your request.</p>

<p>Our smartphone application may locally collect location information to enable discovery of relevant places when you set a location for a plan.</p>

<p>Our smartphone application may collect information related to your phone settings such as time zone, locality settings, and other information related to calendar use in order to provide consistent user experience.</p>

<p>We collect personally non-identifiable data about you when you use the Site. We may store such information in our offices and servers, or in databases owned and maintained by our contractors and partners. We may use personally non-identifiable data to track the amount of page downloads, site visits, and domain names of our users to track the usage of our Site.</p>

<p>When you visit the Site, it may send one or more "cookies" - a small data file - to your computer to identify your browser in order to improve the user experience. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us, but does not collect personal information about you.</p>

<h2>2. Sharing information on Plango</h2>

<p>Plango is designed for private planning of group activities with friends. Plan is the key concept in the Plango sharing and privacy model. Plan includes information on the activity (title and / or interest category such as dinner or sports), inviteed participants (with Attending, Awaiting, Declined RSVP status), date and time, privacy status, and place data. Only the creator of the plan can change the plan data (excluding the RSVP data) or invite new participants to the plan. Plango provides three mechanisms to share plan data:</p>

<p>1) Creating a plan and inviting other users to the plan.</p>

<p>All invited members can view all plan data, join, leave, and comment a plan. New invited members can see all the previous comments of the plan.</p>

<p>2) Sharing a plan to Plango friends</p>

<p>By default a plan has "Private" status, which means that it can only be viewed, commented, and joined by the invited members. Plans with "Friends" status can also be viewed, commented, and joined by all Plango friends of the creator of the plan.</p>

<p>3) Posting a plan to user's own Facebook wall</p>

<p>Creator of the plan can decide to share the plan on Facebook. When Facebook post is selected, Plango will generate a wall post to the creator's wall including the basic plan details (what, where, when, who). However, the plan itself, including the comments, is not visible to Facebook users.</p>

<p>Plans with "Public" status are shown to all Plango friends of the joined Plango users in those events. Public plans cannot be created with Plango but may be fetched from third-party services.</p>

3. How We Use Your Information

<p>To manage the service: We use the information we collect to provide Plango features and services to you, to detect illegal activities, to measure and improve the services, and to provide customer support to you.</p>

<p>To show you relevant content: Plango may recommend events based on user's preferences, usage of the Site, and location.</p>

<p>To customize user experience: To improve the overall user experience and make recurring tasks such as plan creation and location search easier and faster, Plango proposes various shortcuts for selections such as invitees or place selection. These shortcuts reflect your personal and other users collective usage of the system.</p>

<p>To show targeted ads: We do not share your personal information with advertizers without your explicit consent. We may allow advertisers to choose characteristics of the users, who will see their advertisement. For example, we may show you running sport brand related ads that reflect your interest in running, but we do not tell the sport brand who you are.</p>

<p>To contact you: We may contact you in announcements related to our
Service.</p>


<h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>

<p>We may share your activity and other information to a third-party service such as Facebook with your consent. We cannot control how these third-parties use your information.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that it is necessary to comply with law or regulation, or to protect our rights or property.</p>

<p>As a part of business development Plango may sell its assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred assets in these types of transactions.</p>

<h2>5. How We Protect Information</h2>

<p>Plango uses reasonable managerial, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure privacy and security of personal information. However, we cannot warrant that despite of the controls your personal information may not be accessed, altered, or destroyed.</p>

<p>If you have any questions concerning our Privacy Policy, please send us email in info@myplango.com</p>
